    <body> <p> In this world, <em>I want to be many things.</em> <br>
           <p> People tell me I can't be everything, <br>
           <p> I can't let their bitterness control what I think. <br>
           <p> Because with God, <em>I know I can be anything.</em> <br>
           <p><br>    
           <p> Haters can tell me <em>I can't.</em> <br>
           <p> Discouragers can tell me that I won't. <br>
           <p> No matter what everyone would say, <br>
           <p> I believe that <em>I can.</em> <br>
           <p><br>
          <p> Anything I put my mind to, <br>
          <p> I know that's what I can do. <br>
          <p> No matter what everybody says, <br>
          <p> I would always still <em>believe</em> in myself. <br>
