                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p> Tim Bergling, known professionally as Avicii, was Swedish DJ, electronic musician and
                        songwriter.</p>
                    <p>He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single "Levels". His debut studio album True, released in
                        2013, blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and reached the top ten in more
                        than fifteen countires. The lead single "Wake Me Up" topped most music markets in Europe and
                        reached number four in the United States.</p>
                    <p>In 2015 Bergling released his second studio album, Stories. Four singles were released from the
                        album including "Waiting for Love", "Pure Grinding", "For a Better Day" and "Broken Arrows". By
                        November 2015 it had sold one million copies and was the fourth most streamed album of the year
                        on Spotify.</p>
                    <p>Avicii performed his final live performance on 28 August 2016 in Ibiza before retiring from
                        touring citing health concerns. Tragically Tim Berling would pass away on 20 April 2018 near
                        Muscat, Oman, at the age of 2018.</p>
                    <p>Following his death Avicii's final studio album, Tim was released. All proceeds from the sale of
                        the album go towards the Tim Bergling Foundation.</p>

                    <p>The Tim Bergling Foundation was created by Klas and Anki Bergling and their family after the
                        death of their son Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii – one of the most acclaimed and beloved
                        producers/performers/songwriters in modern music.</p>
                    <p>Tim’s parents have endowed the foundation with a significant contribution from his estate and
                        will direct proceeds from future Avicii projects and the recent release of the posthumous album
                        ”TIM" (2019) to the foundation.</p>
                    <p>The Tim Bergling Foundation will advocate for the recognition of suicide as a global health
                        emergency and promote removing the stigma attached to the discussion of mental health issues.
