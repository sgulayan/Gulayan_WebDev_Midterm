    <body> <p> In this world, I want to be many things. <br>
           <p> People tell me I can't be everything, <br>
           <p> I can't let their bitterness control what I think. <br>
           <p> Because with God, I know I can be anything. <br>
               
           <p> Haters can tell me I can't. <br>
           <p> Discouragers can tell me that I won't. <br>
           <p> No matter what everyone would say, <br>
           <p> I believe in myself. <br>
               
          <p> Anything I put my mind to, <br>
          <p> I know that's what I can do. <br>
          <p> No matter what everybody says, <br>
          <p> I would always still believe in myself. <br>
